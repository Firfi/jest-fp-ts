# Contributing to jest-fp-ts

I created this project for my own use, with the idea that at some point it might become a
fully-maintained community project, complete with ci builds, cool badges, and better
documentation.

I'm also only just getting started with fp-ts and io-ts, so I haven't needed to create many
different types of matchers yet. In fact, only Either values are represented at this point. It
wouldn't be hard to cover off other types like Option, I just haven't needed them yet.

If you'd like to help make this into a more general community project, or to add more matchers, I'd
love to hear from you. Please open an issue first to let me know how you're planning to contribute
so we can chat.
